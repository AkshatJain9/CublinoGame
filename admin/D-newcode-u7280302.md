## u7280302 Justin Tieu

For Deliverable D2D, I contributed the following new statements of original code:

- Added an [algorithm that finds the missing sides of a dice by finding its orientation](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7279868/comp1140-ass2-thu11r/-/blob/master/src/comp1140/ass2/base/Dice.java#L88)
- Added [dice toString tests](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7279868/comp1140-ass2-thu11r/-/blob/master/tests/comp1140/customTests/diceTest.java#L48) in `DiceTest`
