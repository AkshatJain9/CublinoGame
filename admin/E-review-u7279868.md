### Comments
The best features of this code are its quite easy to read and the implementation is also solid.
This method integrated nicely with all the other code regarding the GUI of the game. 
Bit of a side note, but the graphics implementation made testing the various situations on the board quite easy and efficient.

The code is well-documented for the most part. A slight nitpick is maybe more comments could have been added for the keypress code. 
But other than that, the comments are enough for me to understand what is going on. 

The variables within this method and the overall package is appropriately named and does consistently follow java code conventions. 
Everything connects together coherently.
