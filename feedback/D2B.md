## General Comments

Hey all! Really well done with your work today! I really do
like how you have abstracted the `Game` class, your use of 
enums, and how you've neatly packaged your project. There are
still a number of design considerations to be made however.
First off, though I like how you've set up your `Direction`
enum I believe there's still some thought to do with what
exactly it represents. Is it a global direction (north, east,
south, west) or relative to each player? Something else
which is slightly lacking in your set up is the consideration
for AI and heuristics. I believe I gave you several ideas 
about this today - such as creating an abstract AI class
and creating bots from it. Other than that, there is just
a few other small minor things like `rollDice`, which while
accurate, `tiltDice` may be a better name to avoid confusion
with the standard connotation of dice rolling. Other than
that really good work with your design and I'm looking forward
to seeing your final result!
